**Goal:** To help the creators of this podcast engage better with their audience

**Description:** This podcast had just released their 100th episode. I analysed the preferences of their listeners so far to help them understand which direction to move forward in. I cleaned the data using SQL and then presented the information in Excel dashboards.

**Conclusion:** There was very little difference between days of the week, while the most popular times of day people were listening were evening and night. Sports and Technology were their most popular genre of episode with education and music being the least popular. The positivity of the sentiment of the episode had no effect on the likelihood of a person listening to an entire episode. However, people were more likely to complete an episode if there were fewer ads - over 6% more likely if there was 1 compared to if there were 3.
